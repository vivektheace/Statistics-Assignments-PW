    "\n",
    "### Types of Skewness:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Positive Skewness (Right Skewness):**\n",
    "   - The tail on the right side of the distribution is longer or fatter than the left side.\n",
    "   - Most values, including the median, lie to the left of the mean.\n",
    "   - Examples: Income distribution in most countries, scores on a very easy exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Negative Skewness (Left Skewness):**\n",
    "   - The tail on the left side of the distribution is longer or fatter than the right side.\n",
    "   - Most values, including the median, lie to the right of the mean.\n",
    "   - Examples: Age at retirement, scores on a very difficult exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Zero Skewness (Symmetrical Distribution):**\n",
    "   - The distribution is perfectly symmetrical around the mean.\n",
    "   - Mean, median, and mode are all equal.\n",
    "   - Example: Heights of adult men in a certain population (assuming normal distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measuring Skewness:\n",
    "Skewness can be quantified using the skewness coefficient. A commonly used formula for skewness is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\text{Skewness} = \\frac{n}{(n-1)(n-2)} \\sum \\left(\\frac{x_i - \\bar{x}}{s}\\right)^3 \\]\n",

    "- \\( x_i \\) is each individual observation\n",
    "- \\( \\bar{x} \\) is the mean of the observations\n",
    "- \\( s \\) is the standard deviation of the observations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation of Skewness Coefficient:\n",
    "- **Skewness > 0:** Positive skew (right skew)\n",
    "- **Skewness < 0:** Negative skew (left skew)\n",
    "- **Skewness = 0:** No skew (symmetrical distribution)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of Skewness:\n",
    "- **Statistical Analysis:** Skewness affects the measures of central tendency and dispersion, and it is crucial to account for it when performing statistical analyses.\n",
    "- **Data Transformation:** Understanding skewness helps in deciding whether data transformation is needed to meet the assumptions of statistical tests that require normality.\n",
    "- **Descriptive Statistics:** Provides insight into the nature and behavior of the data, which is useful for data interpretation and decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "1. **Income Distribution:** Often right-skewed because a small number of people have significantly higher incomes than the majority.\n",
    "2. **Exam Scores:** Can be left-skewed if the exam is too easy, resulting in many high scores.\n",

    "Covariance and correlation are both measures of the relationship between two variables, but they have key differences in terms of their interpretation and scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Covariance:\n",
    "- **Definition**: Covariance is a measure of how much two random variables change together. If the greater values of one variable correspond to the greater values of the other variable, and the same relationship is observed for lower values, the covariance is positive. Conversely, if one variable tends to be above its mean when the other is below its mean, the covariance is negative.\n",
    "- **Formula**: For two variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), the sample covariance is given by:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  \\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \\bar{X})(Y_i - \\bar{Y})}{n-1}\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "  where \\(X_i\\) and \\(Y_i\\) are the individual sample points, \\(\\bar{X}\\) and \\(\\bar{Y}\\) are the sample means, and \\(n\\) is the number of observations.\n",
    "- **Units**: Covariance has units that are the product of the units of the two variables. This makes it difficult to interpret directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correlation:\n",
    "- **Definition**: Correlation is a normalized measure of the linear relationship between two variables. It not only indicates the strength and direction of the relationship but also scales the covariance by the standard deviations of the variables, making it dimensionless.\n",
    "- **Formula**: The Pearson correlation coefficient \\(r\\) is given by:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  r = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{\\sigma_X \\sigma_Y}\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "  where \\(\\text{Cov}(X, Y)\\) is the covariance of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), and \\(\\sigma_X\\) and \\(\\sigma_Y\\) are the standard deviations of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).\n",
    "- **Range**: Correlation values range between -1 and 1.\n",
    "  - \\(r = 1\\): Perfect positive linear relationship.\n",
    "  - \\(r = -1\\): Perfect negative linear relationship.\n",
    "  - \\(r = 0\\): No linear relationship.\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: Since correlation is dimensionless, it is easier to interpret and compare across different datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences:\n",
    "1. **Scale**:\n",
    "   - Covariance is not standardized and depends on the units of the variables.\n",
    "   - Correlation is standardized and dimensionless.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Range**:\n",
    "   - Covariance can take any value from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(\\infty\\).\n",
    "   - Correlation ranges from -1 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interpretation**:\n",
    "   - Covariance indicates the direction of the relationship (positive or negative) but not the strength in a standardized way.\n",
    "   - Correlation indicates both the direction and strength of the linear relationship in a standardized way.\n",

    "Outliers can have a significant impact on measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation). Here's how outliers affect these measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean**:\n",
    "   - The mean is highly sensitive to outliers. A single outlier can greatly increase or decrease the mean, making it unrepresentative of the majority of the data.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Median**:\n",
    "   - The median is less affected by outliers because it is the middle value in a sorted list of numbers. Outliers do not significantly change the position of the median.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Mode**:\n",
    "   - The mode is generally not affected by outliers since it is the most frequently occurring value in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Range**:\n",
    "   - The range is greatly affected by outliers because it is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. An outlier can significantly increase the range.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Variance and Standard Deviation**:\n",
    "   - Both variance and standard deviation are sensitive to outliers because they involve squaring the differences between each data point and the mean. Outliers increase these differences, leading to higher variance and standard deviation.\n",
