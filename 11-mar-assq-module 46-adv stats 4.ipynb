    "The t-test and z-test are both statistical tests used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups. Here are the main differences between the two tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "### T-Test\n",
    "1. **Sample Size**: The t-test is used when the sample size is small (typically less than 30).\n",
    "2. **Population Standard Deviation**: The t-test is used when the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "3. **Distribution**: The t-test uses the t-distribution, which is wider and has fatter tails than the normal distribution, to account for the additional uncertainty in small sample sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Z-Test\n",
    "1. **Sample Size**: The z-test is used when the sample size is large (typically 30 or more).\n",
    "2. **Population Standard Deviation**: The z-test is used when the population standard deviation is known.\n",
    "3. **Distribution**: The z-test uses the normal distribution (z-distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "#### T-Test Example\n",
    "**Scenario**: A researcher wants to determine if a new teaching method significantly improves test scores compared to the traditional method. They have data from a small sample of 20 students who were taught using the new method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use of T-Test**: Since the sample size is small (20 students) and the population standard deviation is unknown, a t-test would be appropriate. The researcher would compare the mean test score of the 20 students against the known mean score of students taught by the traditional method using a t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Z-Test Example\n",
    "**Scenario**: A company wants to compare the average weight of a new shipment of widgets to the average weight of previous shipments. They have a large sample of 100 widgets, and the standard deviation of widget weight from previous shipments is known to be 0.5 grams.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use of Z-Test**: Since the sample size is large (100 widgets) and the population standard deviation is known (0.5 grams), a z-test would be appropriate. The company would compare the mean weight of the 100 widgets from the new shipment against the known mean weight of previous shipments using a z-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "- Use a **t-test** for small samples where the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "- Use a **z-test** for large samples where the population standard deviation is known."

    "### Example Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a medical example to illustrate Bayes's theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scenario:\n",
    "Suppose a particular disease affects 1% of the population. There is a test for the disease that is 99% accurate, meaning:\n",
    "- If a person has the disease, the test will be positive 99% of the time (true positive rate).\n",

    "#### Interpretation:\n",
    "Despite the test being 99% accurate, if a person tests positive, there is only a 50% chance that they actually have the disease.

    "A confidence interval (CI) is a range of values, derived from sample data, that is likely to contain the true population parameter (e.g., mean, proportion) with a certain level of confidence.

The confidence level (e.g., 95%) indicates the probability that the interval will contain the true population parameter if the experiment were repeated many times.\n",

    "### Calculation of Confidence Interval\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate a confidence interval for a population mean, we typically follow these steps:\n",

    "\n",
    "where \\( s \\) is the sample standard deviation, and \\( n \\) is the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Select the confidence level**: Common choices are 90%, 95%, and 99%. Each confidence level has a corresponding z-score (for large samples) or t-score (for small samples with \\( n < 30 \\) or unknown population standard deviation).\n",
    "   - For a 95% confidence level, the z-score is approximately 1.96.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate the margin of error (ME)**: This is the product of the critical value (z or t) and the standard error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ ME = z \\times SE \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Determine the confidence interval**: The interval is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\bar{x} \\pm ME \\]\n",

    "### Example\n",

    "\n",
    "\\[ SE = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{30}} \\approx 1.83 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Confidence level**: 95%, corresponding to a z-score of 1.96\n",
    "4. **Margin of error (ME)**:\n",

    "\n",
    "\\[ (146.41, 153.59) \\]\n",

    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "We are 95% confident that the true mean weight of the population of apples lies between 146.41 grams and 153.59 grams. This means that if we were to take many samples and calculate the confidence interval for each sample, 95% of these intervals would contain the true population mean.\n",

    "\n",
    "The margin of error for a confidence interval for the mean can be calculated using the following formula:\n",

    "\n",
    "### How Sample Size Affects the Margin of Error\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample size (\\( n \\)) has an inverse relationship with the margin of error. As the sample size increases, the margin of error decreases. This relationship is due to the presence of \\( \\sqrt{n} \\) in the denominator of the formula.

    "- **Larger Sample (n = 400)**: Margin of Error = 0.196\n",
    "\n",
    "By increasing the sample size from 100 to 400, the margin of error is reduced from 0.392 to 0.196.

    "\n",
    "The margin of error reflects the precision of an estimate in a confidence interval. Larger sample sizes lead to smaller margins of error, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the statistical inference. This principle is crucial in designing surveys and experiments to ensure that the results are both meaningful and reliable."

    "- Calculated t-value: \\( -5.494 \\)\n",
    "- Critical t-value: \\( \\pm 1.699 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since \\( -5.494 \\) is less than \\( -1.699 \\) (and the absolute value is greater than 1.699), we reject the null hypothesis.\n",

    "### Interpretation\n",
